    "## Key Takeaways and Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects with attributes and methods\n",
    "2. **`__init__` Method**: Constructor that initializes new objects with starting values\n",
    "3. **`self` Parameter**: Reference to the specific instance calling the method\n",
    "4. **Instance vs Class Attributes**: Variables unique to objects vs shared by all objects\n",
    "5. **Methods**: Functions that belong to classes and operate on object data\n",
    "6. **Encapsulation**: Using private methods (prefixed with `_`) for internal logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "- Always use `self` as the first parameter in instance methods\n",
    "- Initialize all instance attributes in `__init__`\n",
    "- Use meaningful names for classes (PascalCase) and methods (snake_case)\n",
    "- Keep methods focused on a single responsibility\n",
    "- Use `@property` decorator for computed attributes\n",
    "- Implement `__str__` for user-friendly object representation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n",
    "- Forgetting `self` parameter in method definitions\n",
    "- Not calling `__init__` properly when creating objects\n",
    "- Confusing class attributes with instance attributes\n",
    "- Making everything public when some things should be private\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are fundamental to object-oriented programming and help organize code into logical, reusable components!"
